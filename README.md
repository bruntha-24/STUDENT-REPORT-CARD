# Student Report Card System

## Project Description

The Student Report Card System is a simple Python-based application that allows users to manage student data, including their grades for multiple subjects. It supports adding new students and grades, displaying report cards for existing students, and calculating the average score and grade. The student data is stored in a text file, ensuring that the data persists across application runs.

### Features:
- **Add Student and Grades**: Allows you to input a student’s name, subjects, and their respective grades.
- **Display Report Card**: Displays the student’s grades for each subject, their average score, and the corresponding grade.
- **Persistent Storage**: The student data is saved in a local text file to ensure data is preserved between sessions.

## Tech Stack Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **File Handling**: Text file (`.txt`) for storing student data
- **Data Storage**: Dictionary to store student data in memory and persist it in a file
- **Libraries**: None (Uses built-in Python libraries)

## Installation/Usage Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bruntha-24/STUDENT-REPORT-CARD.git
